Revision history for Perl extension Image::GeoTIFF::Tiled.

0.07  Wed Jul 21 00:00:00 2010
    - Smaller usgs samples
    - Added more tests
    - Iterator null value now undef, not -1 (some rasters can have negative
      values).
    - Moved get_* and extract_* methods out of C and into Perl. Data is unpacked
      with unpack() and a template and extract_grid and filter_shape no longer
      suffer from memory errors (obviously).
    - Fixed bug in Shape.pm get_parts() where given latitude was not
      being transformed to the middle of the pixel. This caused some latitudes
      to erronously return only 1 vertex when ray-casting. An additional clause
      is now in place in filter_shape() to test for this situation.
    - Renamed many methods to make naming more standardized and sensical
    - Updated pod

0.06  Wed Jul 14 02:24:00 2010
    - Now handles floating-point rasters and bps > 8
    - Added get_iterator_tile[s] methods
    - Exposed constrain_boundary method, which now copies its 
      inputs
    - Added lots of new metadata and sanity checks
    - Added statistics test with new test image (dem)
    - Updated pod
    - Not released to CPAN (passed tests but too many lingering issues)

0.05  Mon Jul 12 15:38:00 2010
    - return value of coordinates are lists
    - removed image reference from Iterator.pm to prevent 
      circular references
    - added adjacencies() to Iterator.pm (adjacent values)
    - added bounds() to Tiled.pm (image boundary)
    - soft-coded null value (-1) to $NULL package variable in 
      Iterator.pm
    - added convenince method get_iterator() to Tiled.pm

0.04  Wed Sep 30 00:00:00 2009
    - improved get_x() efficiency by using part sorting
    - fixed pod code (ticket #51743)
    - lazy test plans in test scripts that require optional
      modules to prevent failed tests

0.03  Wed Sep 02 04:27:00 2009
    - fixed bug where x values during ray-casting were being
      sorted lexically instead of numerically
        --changed get_x() in Shape.pm

0.02  Mon Aug 31 04:10:00 2009
    - allow loading of all multi-part ShapeFile types
        --added reset_points() method in Shape.pm
    - cleaned up distribution
        --removed Tiled.pm from lib/ in make
